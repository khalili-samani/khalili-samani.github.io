  <p>I am a PhD graduate researcher at the University of Melbourne with a strong passion for uncovering insights through data. My academic journey has provided me with a rigorous foundation in abstract theory and advanced problem-solving, while my enthusiasm for data drives me to explore its transformative potential in both research and industry settings.</p>
  <p>I thrive on bridging the gap between deep mathematical concepts and real-world applications. Whether I’m delving into intricate proofs or analyzing complex data sets, I am driven by a relentless curiosity to understand how foundational principles can inspire innovative solutions. My work is characterized by precision, analytical thinking, and a continual pursuit of knowledge.</p>
  <p>Beyond academia, I enjoy collaborating on interdisciplinary projects that leverage mathematical rigor alongside data-driven methodologies. I invite you to explore my portfolio and learn more about my research and projects. Let’s connect and discover how abstract theory and data can drive impactful change together.</p>
